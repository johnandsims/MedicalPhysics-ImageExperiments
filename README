This is a github repository for Medical Physics experiments, created by John Andrew Sims, Bruno Murakami, Isabella Kobb Fernandes Stein and Jorge Lamar.

We offer our articles and code to help in the teaching of modalities computed tomography and ultrasound.  If you are inspired by our ideas, please cite our articles, which have been presented in conference and are awaiting publication by IFMBE, Springer.

We are in the process of developing resources to accompany these projects:
1. Laboratory manual - different versions according to setting.
2. Suggestions for how to apply to a wider curriculum in a school setting
3. Selection of collaborative / social constructivist activities for students group work.

Above all, we hope you find pleasure in using this work, and that it leads to raising the standards of education.
