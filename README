This is a github repository for Medical Physics Image Experiments, created by Prof. Dr. John Andrew Sims, Bruno Murakami, Isabella Kobb Fernandes Stein and Jorge Lamar.

We offer our articles and code to help others who teach imaging modalities -  computed tomography and ultrasound.  

**please cite our articles** if you are inspired by our ideas to create similar experiments and you find yourself publishing.  It helps with our visibility.  

The experiments have been presented in conference, where they have also been showcased, and we are awaiting formal publication details by IFMBE, Springer.

We are in the process of developing resources to accompany these projects:
1. Laboratory manual - different versions according to setting.
2. Suggestions for how to apply to a wider curriculum in a school setting
3. Selection of collaborative / social constructivist activities for students group work.

Above all, we hope you find pleasure in using this work, and that it leads to raising the standards of education.  

If you would like to get in touch, please send me an email.
